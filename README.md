# Tidy Chat

- Remove all of the redundant system messaging, leaving only important system messages
- Block emote spam
- Block spammy "You obtain" messages
- Block spammy "You cast your lot" messages when rolling for loot
- Improve /instance messaging
- Improve received commendations messaging by condensing all earned commendations into a single message
- Quality of Life improvement for quests that require you to `/say some phrase` by rewording it to be copy/pastable
